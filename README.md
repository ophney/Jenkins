# Palindrome Checker (Java)

## Description:
This Java program checks whether a given string is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequences of characters that reads the same forward and backward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.

## Usage:
1. Compile the Java program:
   ```
   javac PalindromeChecker.java
   ```

2. Run the compiled program:
   ```
   java PalindromeChecker
   ```

3. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter a string.

4. The program will output whether the entered string is a palindrome or not.

## Example:
Input:
```
Enter a string: radar
```

Output:
```
radar is a palindrome.
```

Input:
```
Enter a string: hello
```

Output:
```
hello is not a palindrome.
```
